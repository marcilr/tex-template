+++ Thu Sep  6 13:45:21 AKDT 2018 - Would be good if Makefile handled
an arbitrary number of *.tex files in the current working directory.

+++ Mon Aug 11 08:44:24 AKDT 2014 - Difference between
tabular and tabular*.  i.e. tabular* accepts the max table width
as opposed to full page width.

+++ Mon Aug 11 08:44:24 AKDT 2014 - Bold and italics.  \it{}, \bf{}, 

Some of the \textbf{greatest} 
discoveries in \underline{science} 
were made by \textbf{\textit{accident}}.

As you can see, there are three basic commands and they can be
nested to get combined effects.

Note: The commands \it and \bf also work to italicize and boldface
text, but it's not recommended to use them since they don't preserve
previous styles.  With these you can't, for instance, italicize and
make a text bold at the same time.

+++ Fri Aug  8 08:53:04 AKDT 2014 - Add a white space section.

+++ Fri Aug  8 08:53:04 AKDT 2014 - Use of \hspace() for horizontal space
and vspace() for vertical space.

+++ Fri Aug  8 08:53:04 AKDT 2014 - Use of $<$, $>$, \textless,
or \textgreater for symbol generation.

+++ Thu Aug  7 11:22:23 AKDT 2014 - Added use of symbols:
\textbackslash and \textasciitilde and other options for the
tilde ($\sim$ and \texttildelow from the textcomp package

How does one insert a backslash or a tilde (~) into LaTeX?

+++ Thu Aug  7 11:22:23 AKDT 2014 - Is \noindent described?

\noindent
This is the beginning of a paragraph which is not
indented in the usual way.  This has been achieved
by placing an appropriate control sequence at the
beginning of the paragraph.

Conversely, the control sequence \indent forces LaTeX to indent the paragraph.

+++ Thu Aug  7 11:22:23 AKDT 2014 - Have noticed that use of a capital

x Mon Feb  4 12:08:02 AKST 2013 - According to ~/texmf/README:

LaTeX macros under standard $(HOME)/texmf/tex/latex/ are pulled in,
with no extra effort, by LaTeX build.  Sweet.

Thu Aug  4 11:46:57 AKDT 2011 - Need to get $(HOME)/textmf in
